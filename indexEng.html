    <h2>Did you know?<h2>
		<h5>Every day 270 000 recyclable bottles are thrown straight in the bin.</h5>
        <h5>This estimates to 100 million bottles per year.</h5>
        <h5>Every year recyclable bottles and cans worth 35-40 million kroner is left in the city and nature environment.</h5>
	  <h1 id="navlink">BACKGROUND</h1>
      <p>We people rarely do more than we have to. When we buy a bottle or can at the store, we often don't care about returning the bottle for recycling. Most shops
	  have deposit machines, but availabily and convenience makes the easiest solution to just chuck it straight in the trash or in the environment.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  150-200 million kroner is thrown in the trash every year. This is a huge amount of money that society is missing out on, and the sum equals the amount that
	  is raised in the annual TV charity event, TV-aksjonen. Additionally, this waste is a strain on the environment. Both from littering and recycling wrong. Depositing
	  bottles and cans also reduces pollution indirectly. Depositing just one bottle can save enough energy to recharge a cell phone 70 times!
