	  <h1 id="navlink">BACKGROUND</h1>
      <p>
    Us people rarely do more than we have to. When we buy a bottle or a can at the store, we often don't care about returning the bottle for recycling.
    Most shops have deposit machines,
    but availability and convenience make the easiest solution to just throw it straight in the trash or in the environment.<br><br>

    Statistics show that bottles worth between 150 and 200 million NOK end up in the trash or the environment in Norway alone each year.
    That is equal to 100 million bottles that aren’t being recycled yearly.<br><br>

    Plastic bottles and aluminum cans poses a huge threat to the environment, especially towards the wildlife who can be exposed to dangerous pollutants.
    Since plastic and aluminum aren’t organic materials they break down very slow which leads extensive littering.
    Through recycling one can lessen the littering as well as reduce the greenhouse gas emissions considerably.<br><br>

    For example, when you recycle an aluminum can instead of making a new one you save 95 percent of the energy.
    And if you recycle a single bottle you save enough energy to fully charge your cellphone 70 times.<br><br>

    The bottle that get thrown are not just a burden for the environment, but also amounts to large sums of unrealized profit for the consumer.
    With an increased rate for each recycled bottle from 2018 means that the consumers will lose more money in
    the years to come unless the societies recycling habits change.<br><br>

    Based on our research it indicates that a large amount of bottles consumed outside has a higher chance of ending up in the trash or the environment compared to bottles consumed inside peoples home.
    We assume that a large part of the bottles that doesn’t get recycled are bottles consumed outside.
    The reason for this is that bottles and cans that have been saved up has a higher probability of being recycled because the economical
    incentive more bottles give, and it is more convenient to recycle more at once instead of often. For some it can also be considered
    cumbersome to save a single bottle if you are on the move, or go in to a store in order to deposit a single container.<br><br>

    A problem we have identified in the current deposit-scheme is that profit or gain from depositing containers is that it is cumbersome to spend. The easiest
    way to spend the money is when you are in the store, but if you are not going to spend the money there are few that want physical cash.
    Nowadays most want cash deposited to their bank account.

      Easy Pants vision is that every canister gets deposited. Our goal is that bottles consumed outside will be deposited and recycled instead of ending up in
      the trash or the environment.<br><br>

      Through Easy Pant we are going to contribute in solving todays challenges with a new deposit-scheme which is going to supplement the
      missing pieces the existing one has. It is important that we facilitate a system that makes it easier for the consumer to recycle.
      This is something we want to do with Easy Pant which is going to be a benefit for the consumer and the environment.<br><br>

      A new kind of depositing machine will be placed in many suitable locations. These may include places where many people are in
      transit or where people spend time, such as parks and the exit of movie theatres. Typical places where people bring drinking containers.<br><br>

      The Easy Pant machines have a QR-reader which scans your own QR-code from your cell phone or a printed card for those who don’t want or can’t use their cell phone.
      All bottles deposited after the scan counts towards your deposit credit.<br><br>

      The amount saved can be administrated through a mobile app or from the Easy Pant website.
      Users can choose between transferring the saved amount to their bank account, manually or automatically (for example once every month).
      If you don’t want your money transferred to your account, but donate them instead or participate in the existing Pantelotteriet that will also be an option.
      With this solution we hope put an end to both big and small pawn tickets to be exchanged in the store and instead transfer the cash digitally,
      making the depositing-scheme more provident.<br><br>

      The container for the deposited bottles or cans is divided into two sections, one for plastic and one for metal.
      On the way down there is a grinder which compacts the deposited containers and takes it one step closer towards finishing the recycling process.
